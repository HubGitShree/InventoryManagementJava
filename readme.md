# Inventory Management System using Advanced Java Collections

#### This project utilises core java concepts of Java Collections for  storing, adding and deleting items in the inventory. 
#### Keeping in mind my previous assignment's feedback, I have also implemented logging functioanlity. The operations are logged into the inventory.log file. 




## Logging Functionality in Inventory Management System

### Purpose of Logging

- Monitor important events like:
    - Adding items to inventory.
    - Restock notifications.
    - Merging inventories.
    - Errors and warnings.

## Key Logging Features



1. **Log Levels**
    - `INFO`: To log general information like system initialization, item addition.
    - `WARNING`: To log important events requiring attention, such as restocking notifications.
    - `SEVERE`: To log critical errors that need immediate action.

2. **File Logging**
    - Logs are saved to a file named `inventory.log` in the project directory.
    - Appends new logs without overwriting old ones.
